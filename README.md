<h4>The Idea</h4>

- Cabin Collective will provide a home away from home 
- It is an opportunity for those that wish to escape the city and take time away from technology to share quality moments with one another
- Build it, Share it

<h4>Technical Requirements</h4>

Your app must:

• Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
• Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
• Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
• Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
• Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
• Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
• Be deployed online and accessible to the public

<h4> Necessary Deliverables <h4>

• A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
• A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
• A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating • back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
• A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation • instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
• Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
• A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible user stories you created ## Description

User Stories
